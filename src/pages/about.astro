          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Staffinity was born from a simple observation: managing people
            shouldn't be complicated. We saw HR teams struggling with fragmented
            tools, manual processes, and outdated systems that couldn't keep up
            with modern workplace demands.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built Staffinity to change that. Our platform brings together
            personnel management, recruitment, time-off tracking, and analytics
            into one seamless experience. Whether you're a growing startup or an
            established enterprise, Staffinity scales with your needs while
            keeping things simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we're proud to serve companies that trust us to help them
            build better workplaces. Our commitment remains the same: to
            continuously innovate and deliver solutions that make HR teams more
            effective and employees more engaged.
